/**
 * A.D.T: Priority Queue
 * Representation: Heap(BinTree) note "Binary Tree" not "Binary Search Tree"
 * Structure: Symbol Table
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Sometimes we are only interested in finding the smallest or largest element in a collection.
 * â–ª To solve this problem,
 * a Priority Queue that solves this problem in logarithmic time.
 *
 * Notes: A binary tree is "heap ordered" if each node is larger or equal to the keys in that noe`s two children(if any)
 * @param <Key>
 * @param <Value>
